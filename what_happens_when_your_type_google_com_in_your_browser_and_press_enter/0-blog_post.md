# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter?

This question may sound simple, but it’s actually a great way to test how well someone understands how the internet works. It’s often asked in technical interviews because the full answer touches many important parts of the web (like DNS, internet protocols, security, servers) and how your browser displays a website.
In this post, we’ll see what your computer does to load the page when you visit Google. From finding the right server, making a secure connection, sending a request, and getting back the data : all the way to showing the final page in the browser.

## DNS Request – Resolving the Domain

The first step is translating the human-readable domain www.google.com into an IP address that computers can understand.
- The browser checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP for www.google.com.
- If not, it checks the OS-level cache, and if still unresolved, a request is sent to a DNS resolver (usually provided by your ISP or a public resolver like Google’s 8.8.8.8).
- The resolver queries root name servers → top-level domain (TLD) servers (.com) → authoritative name servers, eventually returning the IP address for Google (e.g., 142.250.64.100).

## TCP/IP – Making the Connection
Once the IP address is known, the browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the server over IP.
- The TCP three-way handshake is performed:
  - SYN
  - SYN-ACK
  - ACK
- This ensures a reliable connection is established between your machine and Google’s servers.
- This occurs over port 443, the standard port for HTTPS.

## Firewall – Filtering the Traffic
Between the machine and Google, there are potentially several firewalls: on the device, the router, the ISP, and Google’s infrastructure.
Firewalls inspect packets and may block or allow traffic based on predefined rules.
For this request, port 443 is allowed, so the HTTPS request goes through.

## HTTPS/SSL – Secure Communication
Before actual data is exchanged, the browser and server perform an SSL/TLS handshake.
The server presents its SSL certificate.
The browser verifies the certificate with trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
A shared encryption key is agreed upon using asymmetric encryption, then used for symmetric encryption for speed.
The communication is encrypted and that ensuring privacy and integrity.

## Load Balancer – Distributing the Request
Now that a secure connection is established, the request reaches Google’s load balancer.
Google’s global infrastructure uses advanced load balancers to:

- Route the request to the nearest and most responsive data center.

- Distribute traffic among thousands of servers.

The goal is optimal speed, availability, and fault tolerance.

## Web Server – Handling the HTTP Request
Once routed, the request hits a web server, such as Google’s custom server stack.

The web server:

- Parses the HTTP GET request.

- Checks for cookies, headers, and user agents.

- Decides how to handle the request (e.g., static file vs dynamic page).

## Application Server – Business Logic Processing
If the request needs dynamic content (like personalized search results), it’s forwarded to an application server.
This is where the core logic of the application lives.
The app server might:

- Authenticate the user (via cookies or sessions).

- Track usage metrics.

- Decide what data to fetch from the database.

## Database – Data Storage and Retrieval
The application server queries the database to retrieve relevant information.
For Google, this might include:

- The past search history (if logged in).

- Trends, indexing data, or ad preferences.

- High-performance databases like Bigtable or Spanner return the needed results in milliseconds.

## Response and Rendering
The database response is packaged by the app server, sent back to the web server, and returned to your browser.
The browser receives an HTTP response (typically with HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

The browser:

- Parses the HTML into the DOM.

- Applies styles via the CSSOM.

- Executes JavaScript for dynamic behavior.

- Renders the final page ( Google's homepage)

## Conclusion :

This entire process, from pressing Enter to seeing the homepage, happens in under a second. It involves protocols, servers, and systems.

Understanding this sequence is critical for software engineers, as it touches on almost every layer of modern computing: networking, security, server infrastructure, and browser internals.
